<h2>FAQ's</h2>

<article>	
    <h3>I'm a musician/band. How do I upload my music?</h3>
    <p>
        First @Html.ActionLink("create a FREE profile", "RegisterArtist", "Account", routeValues: null, htmlAttributes: new { id = "registerLink" }) 
        and from there upload your music directly onto Audiostem. We will review the music to ensure that it is suitable for public 

        broadcast and that it is of the correct sound quality. Once your music has been cleared 

        for use we will send you a notification to let you know your music has become active on 

        Audiostem.
    </p>
    <h3>What is the required bit rate when uploading music?</h3>
    <p>
        We require a bit rate equal to or superior to 128Kbps
    </p>
    <h3>What does Audiostem offer?</h3>
    <p>
        At the moment, you can upload whole albums and songs, that you can then listen back on our platform. Very soon you will be able to 
        download your songs in a variety of popular formats such as mp3 or aac, at varying audio bit rates.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ultimately you will be able to have a complete profile with bio, concert dates, ability to link and share all your social pages.
        Audiostem will be your complete asset management system. And the best thing is that it will always be <b>FREE TO ALL ARTISTS</b>.
    </p>
    <h3>How do I get paid for my music?</h3>
    <p>
        When one of your songs is requested through the Audiostem app/web site in a retail space, we will redistribute 20% of the subscriptions 
        paid by businesses based on a ratio of your songs played. 
    </p>
    <p>    
        So the more your music is played, the more money you will receive.
    </p>
    <p>
        When your music is downloaded, you will receive 70% of the fee (coming soon). We are working toward the artist getting 100%, but we are a way away from 

        that at the moment. All in good time. 
    </p>
    <h3>What happens when I get a major record deal and need to join a royalties collection agency?</h3>
    <p>
        Congratulations! You've hit the big time! We'll be first in line to pat you on the back and 

        pop the champagne with you. Of course we'll need to review our arrangement at this 

        point. We manage our clients music catalogue on a quarterly basis so we would ask to 

        have access to your current catalogue on the system until the end of the current quarter. 

        This will give us time to manage our clients expectations and re-configure the system. 
    </p>

    <h3>I'm a business. What can Audiostem do for me?</h3>
    <p>
        Ok let's start with some statistics from MusicWorks a joint research initiative between PPL 

        and PRS for Music to demonstrate the positive effects of music and the benefits it can 

        bring to businesses.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>- A third of customers are willing to pay 5% more in businesses that play music</li>
        <li>- 74% of employees enjoy going to work more when music is being played, and a third are less likely to take time off sick</li>
        <li>- More than half of customers spend more time in a shop that plays music</li>
        <li>- 91% of those surveyed prefer a bar that plays background music – two-thirds said they would not return to their favourite bar if the music was turned off</li>
        <li>- 81% prefer hair salons that play music</li>
        <li>- 82% of gym users like to hear music as they work out</li>
        <li>- Playing music in waiting rooms makes over three-quarters of people more relaxed</li>
        <li>- So, how do we allow this communal experience to grow? Well, that's where Audiostem comes in.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        That sounds great doesn't it? But the problem is that PRS/PPL charge businesses an 

        awful lot of money to play music in their premises. Our research shows that music

        licences for a small shop cost typically £500 upwards. Fees increase based on the size 

        of the premises and on the number of people likely to hear music within the premises. 

        We don't think this is right. In fact this model immediately compromises the benefits of 

        playing music in the first place. We want to help you enjoy the benefits of having music

        in your workplace; to help you increase your profits by enhancing your retail of business

        environment. With Audiostem you pay us a monthly subscription which works out over

        a year to be considerably less than the typical licence fee rates currently charged. In

        addition, your business can actually make money whenever music is requested through

        your venue.
    </p>
    <h3>Sounds good. What do I need to make it work?</h3>
    <p>
        There are some basic requirements needed to make Audiostem work. You will need a 

        broadband internet connection, amplifier and speaker system. In addition you will need a 

        computer, laptop or tablet to access the system itself. We will be happy to help you meet 

        these requirements. Contact us here enquiries@totalresolutionmusic.com and we will 

        arrange an initial assessment of your specific requirements.
    </p>

    <h3>I'm a new listener to Audiostem. How does it work?</h3>
    <p>
        Audiostem is like a music trading post for emerging music talent. Artists upload their 

        music to their own space within the system, we will then provide that music to our clients 

        as a music service. For example your music will be played in client spaces such as bars, 

        restaurants, gyms, health spa's, anywhere that subscribes to our music service. Now for 

        the really cool part, not only will we do this this but subscribers or "listeners" will be able 

        to download your music directly from our website through the Audiostem music app. This 

        cool piece of software will allow listeners to find out where their favourite new bands are 

        having their music played and when they walk into these client spaces or "venues" they 

        will be able to directly request their favourite songs to be played or download directly to 

        their mobile device. 
    </p>
    <h3>What else can the Audiostem app do?</h3>
    <p>
        The Audiostem music app is designed to provide a fully interactive and immersive music 

        discovery experience. Effectively, we will change your mobile device into a jukebox in any 

        venue that subscribes to the Audiostem music service. You will be able to view everything 

        you need to know about the music you are listening too. You will be able to see where 

        and when they are playing their next gig, receive updates and even receive vouchers and 

        special offers direct to your device from the venue. It sounds amazing right? Hit the link on 

        the front page and we will take you straight to your App Store to download the Audiostem 

        music app.
