    <h3>I'm a business. What can Audiostem do for me?</h3>
    <p>
        Ok let's start with some statistics from MusicWorks a joint research initiative between PPL 

        and PRS for Music to demonstrate the positive effects of music and the benefits it can 

        bring to businesses.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>- A third of customers are willing to pay 5% more in businesses that play music</li>
        <li>- 74% of employees enjoy going to work more when music is being played, and a third are less likely to take time off sick</li>
        <li>- More than half of customers spend more time in a shop that plays music</li>
        <li>- 91% of those surveyed prefer a bar that plays background music – two-thirds said they would not return to their favourite bar if the music was turned off</li>
        <li>- 81% prefer hair salons that play music</li>
        <li>- 82% of gym users like to hear music as they work out</li>
        <li>- Playing music in waiting rooms makes over three-quarters of people more relaxed</li>
        <li>- So, how do we allow this communal experience to grow? Well, that's where Audiostem comes in.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        That sounds great doesn't it? But the problem is that PRS/PPL charge businesses an 

        awful lot of money to play music in their premises. Our research shows that music

        licences for a small shop cost typically £500 upwards. Fees increase based on the size 

        of the premises and on the number of people likely to hear music within the premises. 

        We don't think this is right. In fact this model immediately compromises the benefits of 

        playing music in the first place. We want to help you enjoy the benefits of having music

        in your workplace; to help you increase your profits by enhancing your retail of business

        environment. With Audiostem you pay us a monthly subscription which works out over

        a year to be considerably less than the typical licence fee rates currently charged. In

        addition, your business can actually make money whenever music is requested through

        your venue.
    </p>
    <h3>Sounds good. What do I need to make it work?</h3>
    <p>
        There are some basic requirements needed to make Audiostem work. You will need a 

        broadband internet connection, amplifier and speaker system. In addition you will need a 

        computer, laptop or tablet to access the system itself. We will be happy to help you meet 

        these requirements. Contact us here <a href="mailto:enquiries@totalresolutionmusic.com?subject=Audiostem Music Management Business Enquiry">enquiries@totalresolutionmusic.com</a> and we will
