    <h3>I'm a musician/band. How do I upload my music?</h3>
    <p>
        First @Html.ActionLink("create a FREE profile", "RegisterArtist", "Account", routeValues: null, htmlAttributes: new { id = "registerLink" })
        and from there upload your music directly onto Audiostem under the terms of the 
        <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" target="_blank">Creative Commons Licence</a> or even if you are registered with PRS for music. 
        You can easily register with your <strong>Facebook and Google</strong> account.
        We will review the music to ensure that it is suitable for public broadcast and that it is of the correct sound quality. 
        Once your music has been cleared for use we will send you a notification to let you know your music has become active on Audiostem.
    </p>
    <p>
        What we will <strong>not</strong> do is exploit your music and tell you what you should and shouldn't upload, within reason. At TRM, 
        we believe that artists should be free to express themselves, and this is something we abide by no matter what. 
        <strong>Your content will always be your content</strong>; you are merely allowing us 
        to use it for promotional and commercial purposes according to the
        @Html.ActionLink("Terms and Conditions", "TermsAndConditions", "Home", null, new { target = "_blank" }) 
        set out by us, and approved by you. 
    </p>
    <h3>What is the required bit rate when uploading music?</h3>
    <p>
        We require a bit rate equal to or superior to 128Kbps
    </p>
    <h3>What does Audiostem offer?</h3>
    <p>
        At the moment, you can upload whole albums and songs, that you can then listen back on our platform. Very soon you will be able to 
        download your songs in a variety of popular formats such as mp3 or aac, at varying audio bit rates.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ultimately you will be able to have a complete profile with bio, concert dates, ability to link and share all your social pages.
        Audiostem will be your complete asset management system. And the best thing is that it will always be <b>FREE TO ALL ARTISTS</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are still working on it, but the artist <strong>dashboard</strong> will enable you to manage everything about your music in one 
        simple page:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>your albums</li>
        <li>your songs</li>
        <li>your social Media</li>
        <li>your concerts</li>
        <li>you account, including where is your music played, how many times it is downloaded and how much money you have earned through audiostem.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How do I get paid for my music?</h3>
    <p>
        When one of your songs is requested through the Audiostem app in a retail space, we will redistribute 20% of the subscriptions paid by 
        businesses based on a ratio of your songs played. This only applies if you are not registered with PRS for Music. This is why we 
        recommend that you cancel your PRS licence and register for a Creative Commons Licence instead.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our system is more accurate, and the built-in dashboard allows you to stay on top of where your music is played, and how much money 
        you are making through our system.
    </p>
    <p>
        So the more your music is played, the more money you will receive.
    </p>
    <p>
        When your music is downloaded, you will receive 70% of the fee (coming soon). We are working toward the artist getting 100%, but we are a way away from 

        that at the moment. All in good time. 
    </p>
    <h3>What happens when I get a major record deal and need to join a royalties collection agency?</h3>
    <p>
        Congratulations! You've hit the big time! We'll be first in line to pat you on the back and 

        pop the champagne with you. Of course we'll need to review our arrangement at this 

        point. We manage our clients music catalogue on a quarterly basis so we would ask to 

        have access to your current catalogue on the system until the end of the current quarter. 

        This will give us time to manage our clients expectations and re-configure the system.
