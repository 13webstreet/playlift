    <h3>I'm a new listener to PlayLift. How does it work?</h3>
    <p>
        PlayLift is like a music trading post for emerging music talent. Artists upload their 

        music to their own space within the system, we will then provide that music to our clients 

        as a music service. For example your music will be played in client spaces such as bars, 

        restaurants, gyms, health spa's, anywhere that subscribes to our music service. Now for 

        the really cool part, not only will we do this this but subscribers or "listeners" will be able 

        to download your music directly from our website through the PlayLift music app. This 

        cool piece of software will allow listeners to find out where their favourite new bands are 

        having their music played and when they walk into these client spaces or "venues" they 

        will be able to directly request their favourite songs to be played or download directly to 

        their mobile device. 
    </p>
    <h3>What else can the PlayLift app do?</h3>
    <p>
        The PlayLift music app is designed to provide a fully interactive and immersive music 

        discovery experience. Effectively, we will change your mobile device into a jukebox in any 

        venue that subscribes to the PlayLift music service. You will be able to view everything 

        you need to know about the music you are listening too. You will be able to see where 

        and when they are playing their next gig, receive updates and even receive vouchers and 

        special offers direct to your device from the venue. It sounds amazing right? Hit the link on 

        the front page and we will take you straight to your App Store to download the PlayLift 

        music app.
